- 👋 Hi, I’m @theJewelerZ
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and very new at it.  This has become my new hobby and pass-time.  I hope to one day be of value to others trying to learn the things I am learning now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, JSX, React and have not even scratched the surface :)  My goal is understanding how to build web3 applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other developers who are just beginning or well seasoned alike.  I am part of a small dev team at https://thefledge.com/ who are staring to experiment using blockchain in futuristic ways.
